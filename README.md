Natural interactive language

A mixture of ruby, bash and gawk scripting; NIL Natural Interactive Language provides a subshell for Gnu/Linux process automation.

More specifically, NIL interacts between the business process model and the Posix automated processes, through a DSL (Domain specific language) for automation.

This suite of DSL commands are jargon-adopting the usual business ontology, serving as a layer to the more strict posix automation tools.
